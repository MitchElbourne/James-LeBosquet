                  <p class="quote">The first time I met James I was being used as a hair model. I had started cosmetology school many years before, but got discouraged and never finished. After listening to James teach the class I got so inspired I went back to school and completed the program. It’s truly incredible to see the effect a great education can have, and I am living proof. James has helped me find a whole new appreciation for my craft that I have never forgotten.</p>
